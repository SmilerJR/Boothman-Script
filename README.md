# Boothman-Script
BoothmanScript is the best programming language ever made
It aims to make you slam your keyboard and shout "ITS WALTER" in rage - styll
This guide will help you learn how to use BoothmanScript and not be bad.


# ABOUT
As previously mentioned, BoothmanScript is the best language ever made.
BoothmanScript is built ontop of python, and "compiles" your code back into python bytecode, which can be executed directly by python.


# GETTING STARTED

# INSTALLATION
To install BoothmanScript, there a few steps you must do.
## INSTALLATION STEPS  
1. Unzip the boothmanscript.zip file to a new folder you will remember

2. double click "boothc.py" to generate the __pycache__ folder.

3. double click src/main.booth and set it to always open in notepad - optional but saves time

BoothmanScript should now be installed.

# RUNNING YOUR FIRST FILE
(TBA)

# FIRST STEPS
## THE MAIN FUNCTION
In boothmanscript, the first thing that is executed is the main function
this is where your code will go, and may branch off to call other user-defined functions
To define the main function, you must tell boothmancript it is a function, using the "fn" keyword.
```
fn main() do
   //your code goes here
end
```
// means the rest of the line past the 2 slashes will be a comment, and will be ignored by the compiler

## CREATING VARIABLES 
Sometimes in our program, we may want the computer to remember something that we can use later.
To do this, we can use a variable. Variables are changable things the computer can remember.
Defining a keyword is done by using the "let" keyword, followed by the name, = and a value.
```
let number = 50;
```
